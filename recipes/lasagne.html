    <h3>Description: </h3>
    <p>A recipe from my home in Emilia-Romagna, Italy. This lasagne verde made with spinach pasta cannot be beaten. It's excellent if you want to impress some guests — or even yourself. </p>
    <p>It may be a bit time-consuming, but it's well worth the TLC you put into it.</p>

    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <h4>Pasta:</h4>
        <li>5 ounces spinach - rinsed, stemmed, and dried</li>
        <li>⅝ cup semolina flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>

        <h4>Cheese</h4>
        <li>1 pint ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 ⅔ cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li> Make pasta: Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. 
            Bring water to a boil. Add spinach, cover, and steam until bright green, about 2 minutes. 
            Squeeze spinach to remove excess moisture and process in a food processor to make a paste. 
            Add semolina, eggs, and salt; process until smooth. 
            Transfer mixture to a large bowl and stir in enough flour to make a smooth dough. 
            Knead briefly, then cover with a dish towel and set aside. </li>
        <li> Make ragu: In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. 
            Cook and stir carrot, celery, onion, and bacon in hot butter until onion is translucent. 
            Stir in pork, beef, and ham; cook and stir until crumbly and browned. 
            Stir in beef stock, tomato paste, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper. 
            Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. </li>
        <li> While ragu is simmering, make béchamel: Combine butter and flour in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. 
            Whisk to make a roux. Remove from heat, let rest for 1 minute, then whisk in warm milk. 
            Return to heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until thickened. 
            Season with salt and nutmeg. Remove from heat. </li>
        <li> Cook pasta: Prepare an ice bath. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            On a floured surface, divide pasta dough into 3 portions. Roll each portion out to a thin sheet. 
            Cook each pasta sheet in boiling water for 3 minutes; remove and dip in ice water; drain and dry on a clean cloth. </li>
        <li> Finish ragu: Stir chicken livers into simmering sauce. Cook for 1 minute, remove from heat, and set aside. </li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. </li>
        <li> Assemble lasagna: Place 1 pasta sheet in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Spread 1/3 of the ragu, 1/4 of the béchamel, 1/3 of the ricotta, and 1/4 of the Parmesan over pasta. Repeat layers twice. Top with remaining béchamel and Parmesan; dot with butter. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 30 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
